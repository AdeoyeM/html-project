# My first HTML project

This is my first HTML project.

It has an `index.html` page.

<h1>This is the biggest header</h1>
<h2>This is the second biggest header</h2>

<p>This is a paragraph, to be confirmed</p>

//In order to authenticate a commit on github, use 'git push' and refresh github.
<p>⚠️ **A cautionary note on committing to the `main` branch**
It's typically bad practice to commit directly to the `main` branch.</p>

<p>Once a new branch has been created on local device, this needs to be pushed onto github. to do this use: git push -u origin <branch name></p>
